Global Variables: Home Directory Path


Processor -
Contains everything (uploaded to git)
    Data -
        Raw & Partial Data
        Buoy - key file with info by year
        River - discharge , by location, ft^3
        SST - readings for entire area by day
    Downloaders -
        Automatic downloaders for each type of data
        Restarter: runs multiple processes in parallel
    Processed Data -
        Processed Data of each type consolidated into needed ranges
        Buoy by location
        SST by location
        River by location
    Processors -
        buoyextract - converts data to daily, averages ATMP, weighted average of WDIR, average of WSPD
        distanceselector - finds sst locations within limit distance of location
        ssttempExtract - extracts sst data by day for location
        riverextract - extracts river discharge data
        consolidator - combines all data into a single file for each group

Path of all data is:
downloader -> extract -> consolidator -> main

Groups: buoy - sst set - river
    1: dulm5 - [563,23] - st.louis - all times used
    2: pngw3 - [565,73] - boisbrule - 2016 oct, 2018, 2019 dropped due to missing data
    3: sxhw3 - [559,119] - badriver - 2019 dropped due to missing data
    4: pilm4 - [661,249] - pigeonriver - 2012, 2018 dropped due to missing data

Last column of final data is bloom "probability", which is 1 on the day of observation
and decreases by 0.2 for each day from the closest bloom at that location
